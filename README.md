# wordpress
WordPress docker image, powered by s6 supervised nginx unit.

Attempt to fix several of WordPress anti-patterns in ready to deploy container

#### Deprecation notice
- 2023-01-20 Deprecation of WordPress versions prior to 5.9
  * Preparation for PHP8.1 upgrade. 
  * WordPress versions prior to 5.9 have no PHP8.1 support.
  * PHP8.0 active support has ended since 2022-11-28, therefore skipping this release
  * PHP7.4 reached end-of-life on 2022-11-28 and should not be used.
  * Old images will remain, but will receive no further updates, until their eventual removal. Usage is not recommended.
  * This decision will make build stack significantly lighter, ensuring much faster future builds
- 2023-01-21 Retirement of PHP7.4. The king is dead, long live the king!
- 2023-01-22 Replace NGINX + PHP-FPM combo with NGINX Unit
  * Split and rebase image and rework build
  * This is breaking change affecting all images
  * If your setup was vanilla, it should work out of the box
  * If you need nginx, you can set it up as a reverse proxy
  * NGINX Unit is modern application server, replacing old PHP-FPM
  * Independent benchmarks have show that NGINX Unit can handle much higher load and remain stable
- 2023-01-23 WordPress is no longer installed during runtime and it's bundled into the image
  * This renders WP_LOCALE environment variable useless
  * Instead, you will be offered to select locale during the first setup
- 2023-04-09 Deprecation of docker.io hosted images. We're moving to ghcr.io.
  * This is due to Docker Hub's sunsetting of free teams. See docker/hub-feedback#2314
  * If you are using nlss/wordpress images, you should switch to ghcr.io/n0rthernl1ghts/wordpress
  * nlss/wordpress images will be removed in May. Further usage is not recommended, although we'll keep them up to date until then.
- 2023-08-06 Deprecation/removal of linux/armhf architecture
  * 32-bit ARM is [officialy dead](https://www.androidauthority.com/arm-32-vs-64-bit-explained-1232065/).
  * It has been deprecated/removed in the base
  * This improves build speed as buidling linux/armhf is slow and was taking the most of the time
  * Simplifies maintenance
- 2024-05-13 Deprecation of WordPress versions prior to 6.2
  * Old images will remain, but will receive no further updates, until their eventual removal. Usage is not recommended.
  * This decision will make build stack significantly lighter, ensuring much faster future builds

#### Public builds (docker)

See: [packages](../../pkgs/container/wordpress)

You can use public build:
```
ghcr.io/n0rthernl1ghts/wordpress:latest
```

You can also use specific version of WordPress:
```
ghcr.io/n0rthernl1ghts/wordpress:6.2.0
```

Replace version number with desired version, eg. 6.0.2.

### Automatic plugin installer
```
WARNING: This feature is experimental and can fail. Proceed with caution
```

This container can install plugins during container startup defined in environment variable WORDPRESS_PLUGIN_LIST

If environment variable is left empty, or undefined, installer will skip.<br/>
Consider using custom image with plugins pre-installed in order to speed up container startup, and follow the best practices.


Usage example:
```
# Notice that specific version can be defined
WORDPRESS_PLUGIN_LIST=akismet:4.1.8 two-factor
WP_PLUGINS_INSTALL_CONCURRENCY=10
```
`WP_PLUGINS_INSTALL_CONCURRENCY` is optional, and defines how many plugins can be installed in parallel. Default is 5. <br/>
If you have a lot of plugins, you can increase this value to speed up installation, but be aware that this can cause issues, such as overloaded network connection, or even server overload. <br/>
You should not set this value to value higher than number of CPU threads ( * 1.5 ).

Caveats:
* If plugin was previously installed, and not defined on the list, it will NOT be removed.
* Plugins are not activated automatically; This is intentional.
* If container startup speed is crucial (eg. start-on-demand ), don't use this feature, as it will block container startup until all plugins are installed.

#### Extending image
You can extend this image and install plugins during build time, using `wp-plugin` script. <br/>

Example:
```Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/n0rthernl1ghts/wordpress:6.2.0 AS wp-plugins-installer

RUN set -eux \
    && export WP_PLUGINS_PATH="/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins" \
    && wp-plugin download akismet 4.1.8 \
    && wp-plugin download two-factor \
    && wp-plugin download wp-mail-smtp

# Final image
FROM ghcr.io/n0rthernl1ghts/wordpress:6.2.0

# Example: 
# - Install ext-redis with pecl
# - Enable ext-redis
# - Remove pear/pecl cache
# - Put production-ready php.ini in use 
RUN set -eux \
    && pecl install redis \
    && docker-php-ext-enable redis \
    && rm -rf /tmp/pear \
    && cp "${PHP_INI_DIR}/php.ini-production" "${PHP_INI_DIR}/php.ini"
    
COPY --from=wp-plugins-installer ["/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins", "/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins"]
```

### TODO
* ~Disable core updates~
* ~Install/update plugins on the fly using wp cli (with versioning)~
* Install/update themes on the fly using wp cli (with versioning)
* ~Apply theme and eventual plugin customizations using patch files~ (Partial)
* Support automatic install using ENV
* Create users automatically using ENV
